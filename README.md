# Monty Interpreter

[Monty 0.98](http://montyscoconut.github.io/) is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files. Monty aims to close the gap between scripting and programming languages.

#The monty program

* Usage: monty file
        *where file is the path to the file containing Monty byte code
* If the user does not give any file or more than one argument to your program, print the error message USAGE: monty file, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
* If, for any reason, it’s not possible to open the file, print the error message Error: Can't open file <file>, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
where <file> is the name of the file
* If the file contains an invalid instruction, print the error message L<line_number>: unknown instruction <opcode>, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
where is the line number where the instruction appears.
Line numbers always start at 1
* The monty program runs the bytecodes line by line and stop if either:
it executed properly every line of the file
it finds an error in the file
an error occured
* If you can’t malloc anymore, print the error message Error: malloc failed, followed by a new line, and exit with status EXIT_FAILURE.

## Requirements

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c90
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You allowed to use a maximum of one global variable
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are allowed to use the C standard library
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called monty.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* You are expected to do the tasks in the order shown in the project

## Compilation

To compile this project, you can use the following command:

```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty
```

## Allowable opcodes and what they do


|opcode  |  functionality|
| --- | --- |
| push | add element to the 'top' of stack and 'end' of queue  |
| pop  | remove element from 'top' of stack and 'end' of queue |
|pall  |print every member of the structure|
| pint | prints the member value at the top of stack |
| swap | swaps the order  of the 1st and 2nd elements in stack |
| add | add top two member values |
| sub | subtract the top element from the 2nd top element |
| div | divide the 2nd element by the top element |
| mul | multiply the top two elements of the stack |
| mod | the remainder when the 2nd element is divided by the top element |
| comment | there is the ability to parse comments found in bytecode ->'#'|
| pchar | print character at the top of the stack |
| pstr | print the character at the top of the stack|
| rotl | moves element at the top to the bottom of the stack |
| rotr | the bottom of the stack becomes the top |
| queue, stack | toggles the doubly link list implementation style |
| nop | opcode should do nothing |




Examples:
`$ cat opcodetestfile.m`

`push 1`

`push 2`

`push 3`

`pall`

`$ ./montyfile opcodetestfile.m`

`3`

`2`

`1`

`$`

---

`$ cat opcodetestfile.m`

`push 1`

`push 2`

`push 3`

`pall`

`rotl`

`pall`

`$ ./montyfile opcodetestfile.m`

`3`

`2`

`1`

`2`

`1`

`3`

## Exit Status
Exits with status `EXIT_FAILURE`


## Compilation
All files were compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

All programs and functions were compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` using flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic`.

## Styling
All files have been written in the Betty Style.
